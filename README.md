# Project for Tripleten's Software Engineering Bootcamp: "Spots"
This project is an image sharing site.

## Description
This is a webpage that I created for Triple Ten's software engineering program. I worked on this project for multiple sprints. It is the first responsive site that I created, for both desktop and mobile viewing. I used Figma to implement a cohesive "game plan" for how I was going to design the layout of the webpage. I used VS Code to create and edit the necessary HTML & CSS files for this project in the first sprint that I worked on this project. In the later sprints, I used JavaScript, OOP and asynchronous JavaScript and APIs.

## Tech Stack
