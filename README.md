# Project for Tripleten's Software Engineering Bootcamp: "Spots"

This project is an image sharing site.

## Description

This is a responsive web application developed as part of the TripleTen Software Engineering Program. The project was completed over the course of several sprints and showcases the evolution of my front-end development skills.

Initially, I focused on building a responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques. I utilized Figma to design and plan a consistent, user-friendly interface.

In later stages, I integrated JavaScript to enhance interactivity, and ultimately refactored the project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I also incorporated asynchronous JavaScript and external APIs to support dynamic data rendering and interaction.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3

- Responsive design with media queries

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- Object-Oriented Programming

- Asynchronous programming (Promises, Fetch API)

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

- Figma for UI/UX planning

## Video Review

I recorded a screencast video using Loom. In the video, I am reviewed my project and gave an in-depth explanation of the the code used to create this responsive webpage.
