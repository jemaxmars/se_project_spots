# Project for Sprint 3: "Spots"
This project is an image sharing site.

## Description
This is a webpage that I created for Triple Ten's software engineering program. It is for the 
program's 3rd sprint. It is the first responsive site that I created, for both desktop and mobile viewing. I used Figma to implement a cohesive "game plan" for how I was going to design the layout of the webpage. I used VS Code to create and edit the necessary HTML & CSS files for this project.

## Tech Stack
* HTML
